Yo! I'm Aaron. Thanks for stopping by.

# What (is this)

This site is both my portfolio and blog, created in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). I don't post content to social media, so please come back or [subscribe to my RSS feed](https://aaronthayer.net/feed.xml). ([RSS is back](https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/), didn't you hear?)

Blog topics include technical writing, beer, and video games. My photography includes landscapes...and mostly landscapes. Be warned: I write in a sarcastic, self-deprecating and hyperbolic prose. I hope you can still enjoy my work.

It's OK if you don't, btw.

(P.S. Don't expect to see serial commas anywhere on this site. AP style forever!)

# How (did I get here)

In 2008, I graduated from the University of Oregon with a degree in journalism and a minor in history. Then, a few months later, the global financial crisis happened.

No one warned me that new journo grads with a scant few clips wouldn’t be in high demand.

After several years of working at a technical support vendor, I knew it was time to move up and move on. So, I pulled together an application to the master's in writing program at Portland State University. My focus: [Professional and Technical Writing](https://www.pdx.edu/english/masters-in-technical-and-professional-writing). (Ask me about my winding path from journalism to documentation over a :beer: sometime! I prefer high-IBU IPAs.)

Grad school nourished in me a deep appetite for all things technical writing. Since then, I've stayed hungry. Hungry to learn more, experiment and stay relevant across industries. I take pride in my portfolio. I’ve worked at startups and established multinational companies alike. I’ve also worked with non-profits. If I get the chance to create clear, concise content, I'll take it.

As a lifelong Oregonian, and a married man with a mortgage, I’m usually in bed by 9PM these days. But I also enjoy photography. Check out my [pics](https://aaronthayer.net/photos)!

If you like my nonsense, be sure to check out the decade-strong (!) games blog I cofounded: [Silicon Sasquatch](https://siliconsasquatch.com).
