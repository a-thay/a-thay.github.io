Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a graduate of the University of Oregon's School of Journalism and Communication, where I earned a degree in Magazine Journalism and minored in History. Later, I graduated from Portland State University with a Master of Science in Professional and Technical Writing.

I've cobbled together a technical writing career by working across industries including tech startups like ZOOM+Care and established multinational companies such as Smarsh and Convergys. I've also worked with non-profits like National Novel Writing Month and Right 2 Health.

As a lifelong Oregonian, and a married man with a mortgage, I'm usually in bed by 9PM these days.
