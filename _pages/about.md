Yo! Thanks for stopping by.

I’m Aaron. In 2008, I graduated from the University of Oregon with a degree in journalism and a minor in history. Then, a couple months later, the global financial crisis happened.

No one warned me that new journo grads with a scant few clips wouldn’t be in high demand.

After several years of working at a technical support vendor, I knew it was time to move up and move on. So, I pulled together a grad school application to Portland State University. My focus: Professional and Technical Writing. (Ask me about my winding path from journalism to documentation over a :beer: sometime!)

The program helped me discover a love of technical writing. Since graduating, I've found an insatiable hunger to learn more and experiment. I take pride in my portfolio. I’ve worked at startups and established multinational companies alike. I’ve also worked with non-profits. If I get the chance to create clear, concise content, I'll take it.

As a lifelong Oregonian, and a married man with a mortgage, I’m usually in bed by 9PM these days. But I also enjoy photography. Check out my [pics](https://aaronthayer.net/photos)!
