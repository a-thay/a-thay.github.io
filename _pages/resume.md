Experience
----------

**Information Developer IV, Smarsh:**

Cross-functional resource supporting four different products in our organization. I routinely author task-based articles, release notes, changelogs, videos, and more. From KBs to gifs, I've done it all. As a senior member of the Information Development team, I also help guide documentation planning for Smarsh, provide mentoring to junior team members, and offer strategic insight for various initiatives to ensure high-quality end-user documentation. I also co-administrate our Confluence Server for client-facing docs.

**Technical Writer, Smarsh:**

In my first role at Smarsh, I created content for both our client-facing and employee-only KBs. I and a colleague developed a taxonomy for categorization of content by product line, reducing internal confusion and improving the client experience for finding relevant content. I authored mostly in HTML to control the output formatting to a pre-Lightning Salesforce community.

**Technical Content Editor, Zoom+Care:**

As a part of the Product group, I was responsible for creating and managing a variety of MarComm content for public-facing use, including our website, blog, lead generation emails, product releases and more.

**Contract Filing Specialist, Zoom+Care Personal Health Insurance:**

I managed the creation, planning, writing, reviewing and editing of all ZOOM+Care Health Insurance (health plan) technical documentation and member-related communication content (i.e.: EOBs, renewal notifications, member update emails, etc.). I also worked closely with the Compliance, Operations, Membership, Sales and MX/UX teams, among others, to ensure health plan product consistency from concept to operationalization, as well as compliance with applicable state and federal regulations.

**Co-Founder and Managing Editor, Silicon Sasquatch:**

As the site's Managing Editor, I keep the lights on. My responsibilities include managing staff needs, pitching concepts, budgeting stories and organizing our content catalog while working in a fast-paced and competitive genre of journalism.

Skills
--------------------

### Tool Expertise
* MadCap Flare, Confluence Cloud and Server, Jira, Trello, Adobe FrameMaker, oXygen XML, Atom, GitHub, Visual Studio, Pandoc, Adobe Creative Suite, Office Suite, Google Analytics, Power BI, Coveo.

### Collaboration
* **Scrum/Agile collaborator**: Nearly a decade of Scrum experience; **Editor** with 15 years of experience guiding drafts to publication; **Managerial experience** taught me to resolve conflicts and encourage collaboration.

### Programming Languages
* **HTML:** The language I've used the most since creating webcomics on Angelfire pages in the early 2000s. Not a particularly flashy language anymore, but I can create a website from scratch even if it's not pretty.

* **Markdown:** I know enough to post blogs using Jekyll and Ruby. I also author most content for personal and professional projects in Markdown. I often have to convert that content to plain text, but I prefer the syntax.

* **Docs-as-Code:** I won't pretend I've mastered Ruby and gems, or Jekyll and YAML, but I've read enough blogs and tutorials to [create a personal site][ref] using both macOS terminal and Windows PowerShell. I comprehend, and professionally long for, an environment to implement or at least maintain a "DAC" toolchain. I want Netlify; I want Hugo; I want developers to make doc pull requests. I want to merge those pulls into the master repo while I watch a linter check syntax against the Microsoft Style Guide. I want to dabble in several languages to be just a little bit dangerous.

* Basic knowledge of **CSS**, **XML**, **JQL/CQL**, **JSON**, **YAML**
