Welcome!

This is the first post of my redesigned site.

It's been quite an ordeal, but a rewarding one!

How did I get here? Well, I had to ask myself a lot of questions. The answers to which I can now provide...myself.

__Q: How do I stop paying a ton of money to host a basic website?__

- Pay for a domain, but [host for free through GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

__Q: How do I transfer my domain to a new registrar?__
- Browse your new registrar's [knowledgebase](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase.aspx)!

__Q: How (the hell) do I build a website from scratch these days?__
- [Learn a new language](https://jekyllrb.com/)—especially one that [might help your technical writing career](https://idratherbewriting.com/2015/04/15/final-analysis-between-dita-and-jekyll/).
- Download [Atom](https://atom.io/). Be fortunate enough to [have a patient colleague show you the ropes](http://www.brianryer.com/).
- Alternatively, [read the Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io/).

__Q: Cool stuff. But what the hell is Jekyll? What's a gem?__
- Yeah, that stuff is confusing. [Keep](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/video-walkthroughs/) [at](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#homebrew-on-macos) [it](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), [man](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35031998/prepending-bundle-exec-to-your-command-may-solve-this-rails). (Oh, and try not to fuck with Ruby on both Windows and macOS before you know what you're doing. Or do, but I hope you have a stress reliever handy. [Know](https://gist.github.com/jirutka/99d57c82fa8981f56fb5) and [love](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac) your terminal.)
- Once your migraine has stopped, install Ruby and Git to your machine. [Follow Mike Dane's Jekyll tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) to get a basic blog template running locally.

__Q: OK, I think I get it. I can run a local server of my Jekyll site (!), but how do I push it to GitHub? (Also, please explain what a Git is.)__
- Oh boy. Start with [a basic understanding of Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics). GitHub's "Hello World" tutorial [is a huge help](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). You'll learn about branches, forking, inits, pull requests and repos.
- Feeling accomplished? Use the GitHub Pages crash course to [create your first GitHub-hosted website](https://pages.github.com/).
- Then, follow your registrar's documentation to [create a CNAME file for your domain in your GitHub repo while also creating A Records in your DNS settings to link GitHub to your domain](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages). (Wow! I can't believe how jargony and cool you just sounded! [Right? I'm really impressed with us!])

Now would you believe, even after all that work, this website isn't even _close_ to being done? It's not.

After these numerous, but small, victories, I need to:
* Redesign the blog. The stock template isn't doing it for me.
* Add content. You know: my resume, my portfolio—the fun stuff.
* Figure out how to post my photographs. I want to use this site to show off!

I'll keep updating as I make progress on the above. I'm doing this to learn as much as I can about development without actually becoming a developer.

Thanks for reading! You won't find me on social media (yeah, you literally can't @ me), but you can always see what I'm up to over at [Silicon Sasquatch](https://www.siliconsasquatch.com/).
